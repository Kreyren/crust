		Select this option to prevent the firmware from turning
		off the external OSC24M crystal.

config SUSPEND_OSC24M
	bool "Disable OSC24M during suspend"
	depends on HAVE_DRAM_SUSPEND && !NEED_OSC24M
	default y
	help
		If this option is enabled, the external OSC24M crystal
		will be turned off while the system is suspended/off.
